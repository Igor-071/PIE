# PRD Template

Below is the official PRD template that can be used as a reference to any other product (new or existing).

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the core objectives, scope, features, and constraints of the product. It serves as a single source of truth to align product, design, engineering, and business stakeholders around a shared understanding of what is being built and why.

The PRD exists to:

- **Clarify the product vision and goals**, ensuring everyone involved understands the value proposition and user problems we are solving.
- **Define key requirements** and functionalities in a structured and detailed manner to support planning, estimation, and implementation.
- **Enable cross-functional collaboration** by creating transparency and reducing ambiguity throughout the product development lifecycle.
- **Provide traceability and accountability**, documenting the rationale behind decisions and serving as a reference point for future updates or iterations.

This document is intended to be **living and collaborative**. As new insights emerge—through discovery, user feedback, or technical exploration—the PRD should be updated accordingly to reflect current priorities and decisions.
